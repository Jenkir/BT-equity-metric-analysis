<p>The Census Bureau has reviewed this data product for unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and has approved the disclosure avoidance practices applied (Approval ID: CBDRB-FY21-289).</p>

<p><b>Release Schedule:</b><br />
Data in this file come from estimates of business ownership by sex, ethnicity, race, and veteran status from the 2020 Annual Business Survey (ABS) collection. Data are also obtained from administrative records, the 2017 Economic Census, and other economic surveys.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> The collection year is the year in which the data are collected. A reference year is the year that is referenced in the questions on the survey and in which the statistics are tabulated. For example, the 2020 ABS collection year produces statistics for the 2019 reference year. The "Year" column in the table is the reference year.</p>

<p><b>Key Table Information:</b><br />
This is the only table in the ABS series to provide information on select economic and demographic characteristics of business owners (CBO) for U.S. employer firms that reported the sex, ethnicity, race, and veteran status for up to four persons owning the largest percentage(s) of the business. The data include estimates for owners of U.S. respondent firms with paid employees operating during the reference year with receipts of $1,000 or more, which are classified in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), Sectors 11 through 99, except for NAICS 111, 112, 482, 491, 521, 525, 813, 814, and 92 which are not covered. Owners of employer firms with more than one domestic establishment are counted in each geographic area and industry in which the firm operates, but only once in the U.S. and state totals for all sectors. Firms are asked to report their employees as of the March 12 pay period.</p>

<p><b>Data Items and Other Identifying Records:</b><br />
Data include estimates on:
<ul><li>Number of owners of respondent employer firms</li>
    <li>Percent of number of owners of respondent employer firms (%)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>These data are aggregated at the owner level for up to four persons owning the largest percentages of the business by the following demographic classifications:
<ul><li>All owners of respondent firms
    <ul><li>Sex
        <ul><li>Female</li>
            <li>Male</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <ul><li>Ethnicity
        <ul><li>Hispanic</li>
            <li>Non-Hispanic</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <ul><li>Race
        <ul><li>White</li>
            <li>Black or African American</li>
            <li>American Indian and Alaska Native</li>
            <li>Asian</li>
            <li>Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander</li>
            <li>Minority (Firms classified as any race and ethnicity combination other than non-Hispanic and White)</li>
            <li>Nonminority (Firms classified as non-Hispanic and White)</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <ul><li>Veteran Status (defined as having served in any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces)
        <ul><li>Veteran</li>
            <li>Nonveteran</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul></p>

<p><i>Data Notes:</i>
<ol>
    <li>Data are tabulated at the owner level.</li>
    <li>Respondents are informed that Hispanic origins are not races and are instructed to answer both the Hispanic origin and race questions.</li>
    <li>An owner can be tabulated in more than one racial group. This can result because:
    <ul><li>The sole owner was reported to be of more than one race.</li>
        <li>The majority owner was reported to be of more than one race.</li>
        <li>A majority combination of owners was reported to be of more than one race.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>An owner cannot be tabulated with two mutually exclusive demographic classifications (e.g. both as a veteran and a nonveteran.)</li>
    <li>CBO data are not designed to produce estimates for all U.S. business owners as information was only collected for up to four owners per firm. Researchers analyzing data to create their own estimates are responsible for the validity of those estimates and should cite the Census Bureau as the source of the original data only.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><b>Owner Characteristics:</b><br />
The ABS asked for information for up to four persons owning the largest percentage(s) of the business. Respondent firms include all firms that responded to the characteristics tabulated in this dataset and that reported sex, ethnicity, race, or veteran status for at least one business owner so that the classification of owners of respondent firms by sex, ethnicity, race, and veteran status could be determined. Furthermore, the ABS was designed to include select questions about owner characteristics from multiple reference periods and to incorporate new content each survey year based on topics of relevance. Percentages are for owners of respondent firms only and are not recalculated when the dataset is resorted. Percentages are always based on total reporting (defined above) within a sex, ethnicity, race, veteran status, and/or industry group for the characteristics tabulated in this dataset.<br />

<p>Owner characteristic topics for the 2020 ABS included in this table are the following:</p> 
<ul>

<li>Highest Level of Education Completed (EDUC)</li>
